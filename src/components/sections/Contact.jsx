//     <p>I've been working with various forms of Developement for more than fifteen years. I love making processes more efficient, more informative, and more impactful. Whether that means designing Websites to help funnel activity into a business for the first time or taking existing Internal Tooling and building upon it. I'm proficient in front end design (HTML, CSS, current web-protocols, accessibility, etc..), Javascript/Node.js, MySQL, and working with APIs.

//     I currently work at Mailchimp as a Technical Support Engineer -- where I split my time between acting as a subject matter expert for front-line Product Support Reps and developing/maintaing/scaling internal components such as Slackbots, tooling for custom DNS lookups and incident response, and JIRA integrations.</p>
