## Description
This is re-work of sorts of my initial portfolio, but in React! 

The styling and interactivity is handled in large part by Bootstrap, with some customization on my end. I'm also utilizing a handful of packages such as ```react-scroll``` to help build some state into the app and handle navigating between the navbar and each section.
